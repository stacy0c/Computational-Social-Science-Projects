        "In practice, using deep learning for computational social science requires building on the foundational concepts covered in this notebook to implement models with more complicated data and architecture. However, there are many strategies can help you navigate the model ecosystem, some of which we will discuss here:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Documentation (and other resources like tutorials) is a goldmine of information for implementing particular algorithms and completing specific tasks. This is one reason why reading and translating code written by others is a key skill.\n",

        "3. Computational resources are important for running complex models. Google Colab has access to GPUs, but does have limitations for large and extended jobs. In those cases, options are paid services such as Google Colab Pro or on-campus [resources](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/overview/).\n",
