    "Ridge: Ridge helps with multicollinearity that is an issue with the data. It provides a shrinkage penalty with which can help with the bias-variance tradeoff, by reducing variance and reducing MSE. Ridge has an advantage over lasso as it keeps all of the predictors in the model. However, Ridge can make it difficult to interpret coefficients as they regularize the coefficient estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso: Lasso is similar to Ridge as it helps with multicollinearity. It also creates a shrinkage penalty. And it could perform better than ridge because it shrinks insignificant variables completely to 0 and removes them-- we have a large number of variables so Lasso can be a better model than Ridge. However, it can increase the bias. "

    "The bias-variance tradeoff relates to the idea that a model needs to balance overfitting (bias) vs underfitting (variance). Similar to the idea in social science that researchers can run into issues of internal and external validity. If there is bias in the data, the model might not be able to capture what's happening in a complex system and the model is too simple. The model would perform poorly on training data. If there is high variance, that means the model is too sensitive to small changes/ noise in the training data. This means that the model may have been overfitted to its training data and picks up on the noise-- it can't generalize to new data. And it is a tradeoff because researchers need to decide how over/underfitted a model is, and need to choose better models or adjusting hyperparameters. "

    "Overfitting happens when models fit the training data too much and has high bias. The model picks up on noise in addition to the actual patterns and doesn't have the ability to generalize to other data. It's an issue in machine learning because models we use in ML typically uses a large number of parameters and are at risk of overfitting. To address it, we can do what we did in this project and cross-validate by splitting the data and train then validate it. We can also use regularization techniques like Lasso and Ridge which adds penalty terms to models to discourage overfitting. We can also remove irrelevant features in the dataset before fitting the model, which I did with zip codes. We can also use ensemble methods like random forests which combines models to improve generalization. "

    "In this analysis, I cleaned the data to transform string variables into numeric. We made states into regions to simplify. And we took out unecessary variables. Then, I partioned data for training, validation, and test. Then I tried three different models: linear regression, lasso, and ridge and looked at which one fit the best. I made a scatter plot to look at prediction v outcomes, and root mean squared errors. Then I retrained it and predicted on test data, then cross validated. First, I found that a ridge model works best here, which makes sense as most of the variables in the data have a linear relationship with diabetes. Second, there is high collinearity, meaning that a linear regression will not be able to fit the data the best. And third, after testing different models, I find that ridge works better than LASSO-- this makes sense to me intuitively as we apply an alpha penalty, but ridge keeps all of the features in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also find (see above) that the Southeast and South should be the priority for the pilot program because of the high predicted rates of diabetes. I'd suggest that we add other variables into this analysis such as health status, other co-morbidities, access to nutritious foods, and others. I don't think sociodemographics alone are enough to figure out the best ways to prevent disease. There are a high number of confounders correlated with sociodemographics that can affect diabetes that we'd also want to understand, such as income or insurance. I'm not confident in employing this in the real world. "
